ASP.NET Core Programming
- Create Models using EntityFrameworkCore (EFCore)
	- Insall EFCore Packages
		- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
		- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
		- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
		- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools

- TO install 'dotnet ef' command in global scope run the followi gcommand

dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef

	
	- Database First Approach
		- Database is ready with tables and Model classes are generated using following command from the
		Command Prompt
		- dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "<Connection-String>" 
				Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -o Models -t <TableName1> <tablename2>..		

Creating Models using EF Core Database First Approach

-- If using Windows Auth.
dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=Company;Integrated Security=SSPI;MultipleActiveResultSets=true" Microsoft.EntiryFrameworkCore.SqlServer -o Models  

-- If using SQL Auth.
dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=Company;User Id=sa;Password=<PWD>;MultipleActiveResultSets=true" Microsoft.EntiryFrameworkCore.SqlServer -o Models  





		- The above command will generate DbContext class with CLR objects aka entity classes mapped
		with tables used in command using <TableName>
			
	- Code-First Approach
		- Create Entity Classes with COnstraints and Relationships
		- Create DbContext class that is having public DbSet<EntityClass> proprties
		- Define mapping / relationship explicitely using code
		- Generate Database and tables using following commands
		- Generate Migrations
			- dotnet ef migrations add <MIGRATIONNAME> -c <Namespace-Path-of-DbContext-Class>
				- Generate Migration and mapping files for the database
		- Update database (Create database if not exist and generate tables in it)
			- dotnet ef database update -c <Namespace-Path-of-DbContext-Class>
			
	- DbContext Object
		- Manage Db Connections
		- Map the CLR object or Entity Class with Database table
			- DbSet<T> class to map CLR object with the Database Table
				- T is the CLR object that will mapp with Table of name T
				- e.g. DbSet<Product>, Product class map with Product Table
		- Manage Transactios
	- Consider CompanyContext is class derived from DbContext and have DbSet<Employee> Employees property
		then
		- Consider 'ctx' is an instance of CompanyContext class
		- To read all data from Employees table
			- ctx.Employees.ToList(); ctx.Employees.ToListAsync();
			- returns an IEnumerable<Employee>
		- TO Create a new Employee
			- Create an instance of Employee class e.g emp
			- Set all Property Values
			- ctx.Employees.Add(emp); OR ctx.Employees.AddAsync(emp);
			- Commit Transactions
				- ctx.SaveChanges(); OR ctx.SaveChangesAsync();
		- To Read a record based on Primary Key
			- ctx.Employees.Find(P.K.); OR ctx.Employees.FindAsync(P.K.);
		- To update  record
			- Search record based on P.K.
			- Update its property values
			- COmmit Transactions
		- To Delete record based on P.K.
			- Search record based in P.K.
			- ctx.Employess.Remove(Searched Record);
			- Commit Transactions

			
- ASP.NET Core MVC Folders (with Individual User Authentication)
	- Models
		- Contains all Model classes e.g. Entity Classes, Data Access Logic, Validations, 
			Model Specific bsiness Logic
	- Controllers
		- MVC Controllers 
	- Views
		- MVC Views
		- Layout Views
		- Shared Views e.g. Error
	- wwwroot folder
		- This folder will be used to contains 'static files(?)'
			- Static files are
					- JavaScript Files
					- CSS Files
					- Images
		- This folder will be used by hosting process (Self-Host/IIS/Docker/Cloud) to read and add the
			static files in HTTP Response
	- Area
		- Folder to contains Identity Web Razor Pages (WebForm)
		- This folder will also contain the separate MVC project structure 

- Frameworks
	- Microsoft.NETCore.App
		- The .NET Core Process, used to provide the following
			- Process to execute .NET Core
			- Memory Management
			- Porvides Standard Libraries to Application
	- Microsoft.AspNetCore.App
		- Package for ASP.NET Core
			- Hiosting
			- Dependency Injections
			- Sessions
			- MVC Request Processing
			- Web Forms Request Processing
			- API Request Processing
			- Identity
			- Caching
			- SignalR
	
 

- ASP.NET Core MVC and API Apps
	- Create ASP.NET Core application and understand the Concept of Project
		- Program class containing Main() metod
			- The Host class that will create an instace of Hosting Environment using HostBuilder to
				- Create Host
				- Manage Server
				- Manage Dependencies using Startup class
					- Constructor Injects the Appliction Confguration in Startup class using
						- IConfiguration interface
						- Application COnfigurations
							- ConnectionString
								- Database Connections
								- CosmosDB Connnections
								- RedisCache Connections
							- Logging
							- Hosting
							- Custom Configuration
								- Any Custom Settings e.g. JWT Keys
					- Cookies
					- Dependency Container
						- Database Connections
						- Sessions
						- Identity Management
						- CORS Policies
					- Reuest Processing for
						- WebForms
						- MVC And API Controllers Together
						- API Controllers
				- Manages Middlewares using Startup class

		- Startup class
			- Uses IConfigration interface as constructo injected
			- Have 'ConfigureServices()' method accepting IServiceCollection as input parameter
				- IServiceCollection, interface impelemnts IList<ServiceDescrioptor>, 
						ICollection<ServiceDescripor>, IEmumerable<ServiceDescriptor>
				- ServiceDescriptor class
					- Used to look for dependency types (aka classes) and register in DI Container using
						following strategies (aka lifecycle management)
							- Singleton, always global
								- The type (instance of class) will be registered throught 
									the lifetime of the applciation
							- Scoped, always stateful
								- The type will be registered for a lifetime of the session 
							- Transient, always stateless
								- The type will be instantiated for a specific request
				- This method manages	
					- DI Container for
						- Registering DbContext objects
						- Custom Repositories
							- Repository Pattern having the Business classes registered in DI Container
						- Identity
							- Authentication
								- User Based Authentication
							- Authorization
								- Role Based Security
								- Policies
									- Combination of multiple roles
						- Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing (CORS) policy for API
						- Session configuration
						- Caching Configuration
					- WebForm Request Processing
						- AddRazorPages() method
					- MVC COntrollers and API Controllers Processing
						- AddControllersWithViews() method
					- API COntroller Processing
						- AddControllers();
			- Have 'Configure()' method accepting IApplicationBuilder and IHostingEnvironment parameters
				- IApplicationBuilder
					- Used to manage Middlewares to Execute or Process Http Request
				- IHostingEnvironment 
					- USed to manage the Hosting environment to execute the application. 

	- Create Repositories
	- Create Controllers
		- Model Validations
		- Exception Management
		- Filers
		- RouteData Property of the ControllerBase class represents trhe Route Expression 
			- Property 'Values', to read the Route Expression
				- Values["controller"]
				- Values["action"]
	- Implementing 	Action Filters
		- ASP.NET Core executes Action Filters by Order
			- The Interface IActionFilter and Abstract Base Class ActionFilterAttribute
				- OnActionExecuting, In IActionFilter and ActionFilterAttribute
				- OnActionExecuted , In IActionFilter and ActionFilterAttribute
				- OnResultExecuting, In IActionFilter
				- OnResultExecuted In IActionFilter
			- Filter can be applied in
				- Global Scope
				- Controller Level
				- Method Level
			- Order of Execution
				- Global
					- OnActionExecuting
				- Controller
					- OnActionExecuting
				- Action
					- OnActionExecuting
				------ Action Execution --------	
				- Action
					- OnActionExecuted
				- Controller
					- OnActionExecuted
				- Global
					- OnActionExecuted
		- Action Filter for enhancing Custion Exception Management in ASP.NET Core MVC Apps
			- IExceptionFIlter intreface
				- OnException() Method
					- Accepts 'ExceptionContext' object as parameter
						- USed for Handing Exception
						- Defining the Result as a resonse when the Exception occures
						- Exception object to Read/log exception
		- Implement Action Filters if you want to handle logic only limited for MVC / API COntroller
			request execution
		- To apply Action FIlter at global level use
			- services.AddControllersWithView(options=> {
			  options.Filters.Add(type of the Custom Action Filter)
			})
		- To Apply the Action Filter at Controller and Action Level apply it using attributes
			[<Name-Of-Filter-Class>]
	- Adding Views
		- ViewResult(), the Razor Page, bound to the model and will display data from model or accept data
			for model
		- PartialViewResult(), the Razor reusable page bound to the model and will display data from model or accept data
			for model
		- ASP.NET Core uses 'TagHelper(?)' top bind the Model classes with Views 
			- They are the Custom Attributes to HTML elements having server-side executions 
			- asp-for
				- used to bind model property with HTML element
			- asp-action
				- used to execute the Action from from control in PostBack or Routing
			- asp-controller
				- used to load the controller in postback or routing
			- asp-items
				-  Used to generate HTML elements based on Collection
			- asp-validation-for
			- asp-route
		- A View can accept 'Only-One-Model' object for scaffolding
			- to pass additional data from different model to the view, use the ViewDataDictionary
				- ViewBag / ViewData
					- They are the 'Action-Scoped' object used to carry data  from an action to view and
						View to action.
					- An Action-Scoped means the ViewData / ViewBag will be killed when the action execution
						is completed
					- If a view is using ViewData / ViewBag object, then all action methods returning to
						the same view must pass ViewBag / ViewData to the view.
				- If ViewBag / ViewData is used in PostBack operation from View, then the 'key' of 
					ViweBag / ViewData must match with the Model class property that is used foe postback
						e.g. If EMployee model is posted back with DeptNo property then the VeiwNag /ViewData
							will be
									- ViewBag.DeptNo / ViewData["DeptNo"]
		- The View is rendered using jQuery Validation Library
			- Unobstrisive JQuery Library 
		- All HTML Tag helpers will be executed on server using the namrespace
			@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers


		
	- Sessions
		- ISession interface. The contract beteween the ASP.NET Host Process and the Session Store
			- The Sesion store is InMemoryDestributedCache.
			- AddSession(), the method that will be used to store the sessions on server side
			- AddInMemoryCache(), to store the session information aka session objects
			- UseSession(), the middleware used to provides session support to all requests
		- If you want to store the CLR object in Session, then define a SessionExtension class for 
			ISeesion interface and implement methods to store session data in it in JSON Serialize format
	- Security
	- Create APIs
		- Security
		- All premptive types are passed in Http Request Header
			- e.g. int, string, double, boolean.
		- HTTP Methods
			- HttGet()/HttpGet("<Template>")
			- HttPost()/HttpPost("<Template>")
			- HttPut()/HttpPut("<Template>")
			- HttDelete()/HttpDelete("<Template>")
		- Model Binders
			- Used to map the posted data from HTTP Post / Put request to CLR Object
				- FromBody
				- FromRoute
				- FromQuery
				- FromForm
				- FromHeader
		- ControllerBase
			- Base class for API Controller. Contains methods for HTTP Responses	
				- Ok() / OkResult() ---> Http Status code as 200/201 and JSON Objeect Serialization 
					using OkResult()
				- NotFound(), NoContent(), BadRequest()		
		- ApiControllerAttribute class
			- Used to Map the Data from Http Request body to CLR object for Post and Put requests
				- Read data from Body and Deserialize it to CLR  object
					- Implicit execution of FromBody	
		- 


	- Middlewares
- Deployment
